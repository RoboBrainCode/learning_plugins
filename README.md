Requires nltk to be installed (do `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt` in Backend).

Two nltk packages are also necessary:

1. wordnet
2. maxent_treebank_pos_tagger

To download these, run

`python -m nltk.downloader`

and select the two packages in the GUI (enter 'd' for download and then the package name from above)
